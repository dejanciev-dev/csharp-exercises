A collection of C# exercises covering language fundamentals, data structures, LINQ, object-oriented design and classic algorithms. Every exercise is covered by xUnit tests.

## Exercises

| Topic | Exercise | Concepts |
|---|---|---|
| **Basics** | [FizzBuzz](src/CSharpExercises/Basics/FizzBuzz.cs) | tuple pattern matching, switch expressions |
| | [MathHelpers](src/CSharpExercises/Basics/MathHelpers.cs) | primes, factorial, Fibonacci (`yield return`), GCD |
| **Strings** | [StringExercises](src/CSharpExercises/Strings/StringExercises.cs) | reverse, palindrome, anagram, run-length encoding, word frequency |
| **Collections** | [Stack&lt;T&gt;](src/CSharpExercises/Collections/Stack.cs) | generics, a growable array from scratch |
| | [BracketValidator](src/CSharpExercises/Collections/BracketValidator.cs) | using a stack to check nesting |
| | [LruCache&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;](src/CSharpExercises/Collections/LruCache.cs) | O(1) cache with a dictionary and a linked list |
| **LINQ** | [LinqExercises](src/CSharpExercises/Linq/LinqExercises.cs) | `GroupBy`, `MaxBy`, `CountBy`, `Chunk`, records |
| **OOP** | [Shapes](src/CSharpExercises/Oop/Shapes.cs) | abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, primary constructors |
| | [BankAccount](src/CSharpExercises/Oop/BankAccount.cs) | encapsulation, invariants, guard clauses |
| **Algorithms** | [Sorting](src/CSharpExercises/Algorithms/Sorting.cs) | bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort (generic) |
| | [Searching](src/CSharpExercises/Algorithms/Searching.cs) | binary search, Two Sum with a hash map |

## Project structure

```
csharp-exercises/
├── src/CSharpExercises/          # exercise implementations, one folder per topic
└── tests/CSharpExercises.Tests/  # xUnit tests for every exercise
```

## Getting started

Requires the [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dejanciev-dev/csharp-exercises.git
cd csharp-exercises
dotnet test
```

## Roadmap

Ideas for upcoming exercises:

- [ ] **Async**: parallel downloads with `Task.WhenAll`, cancellation tokens, `IAsyncEnumerable`
- [ ] **Data structures**: linked list, binary search tree, min-heap / priority queue, graph with BFS & DFS
- [ ] **Algorithms**: dynamic programming (coin change, longest common subsequence), Dijkstra
- [ ] **Design patterns**: strategy, observer, factory, decorator, builder
- [ ] **Modern C#**: records with `with` expressions, list patterns, generic math (`INumber<T>`), `Span<T>`
- [ ] **Benchmarks**: comparing the sorting algorithms with BenchmarkDotNet
